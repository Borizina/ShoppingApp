This project involves creating a React Native application that mimics a simple shopping app based on a given design from Figma. 
The app consists of two main screens: a product listing screen and a checkout screen. Each product includes details such as name, price, and an image.
Home Screen: Consist of;
Product List: Displays a list of products, each with an image, name, and price.
Navigation: A button to navigate to the checkout screen.
Checkout Screen:
Product List: Displays the products added to the cart, each with an image, name, and price.
Total Calculation: Shows the estimated total price for the products in the cart.
Navigation: A button to navigate back to the home screen
This app serves as a foundation that can be expanded upon with more features and enhanced UI/UX based on further requirements from the Figma design.
